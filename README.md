# Turing Machine Simulator
## Short description
A Turing machine is an extension of a finite state machine and, according to the Church-Turing thesis, is capable of simulating all executors who somehow implement a step-by-step computation process in which each step of the computation is quite elementary.

That is, any intuitive algorithm can be implemented using some Turing machine.

## Project Description
My project is a simple implementation of a Turing machine. The project implements the basic principles of the Turing machine: a tape with symbols, a table for indicating the operation of the program
### GUI
The main working window contains a ribbon, table and various buttons for convenient interaction with the project.
### What was used
* ะก++20
* QT Framework
* STL
